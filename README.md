cd <repository-directory>
```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `api` directory:
   ```bash
   cd api
   ```
2. Configure the database connection and Okta credentials in `application.properties`:

   ```properties
   # Database configuration
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/<your-database-name>
   spring.datasource.username=<your-database-username>
   spring.datasource.password=<your-database-password>

   # Okta configuration
   okta.oauth2.client-id=<your-okta-client-id>
   okta.oauth2.client-secret=<your-okta-client-secret>
   okta.oauth2.issuer=<your-okta-issuer>
   ```

3. Start the Spring Maven application:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the `client` directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
